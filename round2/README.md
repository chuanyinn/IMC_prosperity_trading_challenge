## Algorithm challenge

During this second round of the Prosperity challenge, you again get the chance to trade the same products as in round 1. In addition, a new product is introduced: `ORCHIDS`. `ORCHIDS` are very delicate and their value is dependent on all sorts of observable factors like hours of sun light, humidity, shipping costs, in- & export tariffs and suitable storage space. Can you find the right connections to optimize your program?

Position limits for the newly introduced products:

- `ORCHIDS`: 100

## Manual challenge

You get the chance to do a series of trades in some foreign island currencies. The first trade is a conversion of your SeaShells into a foreign currency, the last trade is a conversion from a foreign currency into SeaShells. Everything in between is up to you. Give some thought to what series of trades you would like to do, as there might be an opportunity to walk away with more shells than you arrived with.
